Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players. It involves hitting a ball with a bat and scoring runs by running between the wickets or hitting boundaries. The fielding team aims to dismiss the batters to prevent runs. There are different formats of cricket, ranging from Test matches to Twenty20.
